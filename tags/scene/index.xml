      <description>The main aim of the project is to find four parallel data sets on a specific domain and performing exploratory data analysis. Insights produced from this process are visualised using different plots. After thorough research, we had summarised the root cause of deaths due to factors like shooting incidents, drug use, criminal courts and other leading causes of deaths in the United States of America. Also, we estimated the death rates as per factors like gender, race, targeted locations, and boroughs.</description>
