      <description>Bone Age Assessment (BAA) is a medical test undertaken to identify the difference between a child’s skeletal bone age and chronological age, and the disparity between the results will often suggest either hormonal or skeletal system development anomalies . The estimation of pediatric bone age using the radiological dataset comparing with the standard hand atlas can help in determining hormonal or endocrinological diseases and forethought on the pediatric orthopedic surgeries .</description>

To alleviate poverty, business strategy is followed which is gained from literature reviews and surveys. The dataset is taken from Kaggle and it consists of 10,000 instances with 143 variables. Data preprocessing is done based on the business required and the implementation part is done by building machine learning models. The data preprocessing steps were implemented in the R programming language and the model implementation part was done in Python programming language.</description>

      <description>The main aim of the project is to find four parallel data sets on a specific domain and performing exploratory data analysis. Insights produced from this process are visualised using different plots. After thorough research, we had summarised the root cause of deaths due to factors like shooting incidents, drug use, criminal courts and other leading causes of deaths in the United States of America. Also, we estimated the death rates as per factors like gender, race, targeted locations, and boroughs.</description>
